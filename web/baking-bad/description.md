# Baking Bad

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Author:** 0xjeppe  

This new kid on the block, Bake'n'berg, has taken over the market with some new dough that has 99.2% purity. Ours is not even 60%!

Our bakers have been trying to come up with a new P2P-recipe trying all sorts of weird ingredients to raise the purity, but it's so costly this way.

Luckily, the developers at Brunnerne have come up with a `bash -c 'recipe'` that can simulate the baking process.
This way we can test ingredients in a simulator to find ingredients that result in a higher purity - without wasting any ressources.
