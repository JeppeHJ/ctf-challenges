This is a collection of various Capture The Flag-challenges I have created.
Challenges are stored by category and each challenge has a `src`-folder with the files used to generate and/or host the challenge and a `solution`-folder with a solve-script and short writeup. Note: None of these folders are normally available for the solvers. 
If a challenge is meant to have a handout, which IS available to solvers, then that folder will also be found within the challenge.
