This is a collection of various Capture The Flag-challenges I have created.

## Details
Challenges are stored by category and each challenge has a `src`-folder with the files used to generate and/or host the challenge, and a `solution`-folder with a solve-script and short writeup. *Note: None of these folders are normally available for the solvers.*

If a challenge is meant to have a handout, then that folder will also be found within the challenge-folder. *Note: This folder is normally available for the solvers.*

## Setup

Each challenge has a `docker-compose.yml` that makes hosting the challenge and/or the handout extremely convenient! Simply follow the instructions below and you're all set:
```bash
cd CHALLENGE/src
sudo docker compose up
```
